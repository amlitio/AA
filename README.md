# LLM Model Training

This repository contains the code for training a simple LLM model using PyTorch.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9.0 or higher

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Running the Model

1. Update the `main.py` file with your desired input size, output size, and initial state for the Game class.
2. Run the `main.py` file: `python main.py`. This will train the LLM model and save it as `saved_model.pt`.

## Loading the Trained Model

1. Initialize an LLM model with the appropriate input and output sizes.
2. Load the saved model's state dictionary using `llm.load_state_dict(torch.load("./saved_model.pt"))`.





###<
saved_model:
The saved_model.pt file is generated when you save the trained LLM model using torch.save(llm.state_dict(), "./saved_model.pt"). You don't need to create this file manually; it will be created when you run the training script (main.py).

Step by step guide on how to run the model from GitHub:

Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine: 
git clone xxx

Change into the repository's directory:
bash
cc:
cd your_repository
Install the required dependencies:

cc:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Update the main.py file with your desired input size, output size, and initial state for the Game class.
Run the training script:

css
cc:
python main.py
This will train the LLM model and save it as saved_model.pt.

To load and use the trained model in another script or project, follow these steps:
a. Initialize an LLM model with the appropriate input and output sizes.

b. Load the saved model's state dictionary:

python 
cc:
llm.load_state_dict(torch.load("./saved_model.pt"))
Now you can use the trained model for making predictions or further fine-tuning.
